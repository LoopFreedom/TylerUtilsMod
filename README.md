# TylerUtilsMod #
The TylerUtilsMod is created by tylerhyperHD, a Lead Developer of EpicFreedom. This was coded to run alongside the TotalFreedomMod, made by MadGeek40 and Prozza, and run with CraftBukkit and Spigot servers. This was also made to run not as a derivative of the plugin, but as a multi-structured plugin to be used with even vanilla Minecraft servers.
